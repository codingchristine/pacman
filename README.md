# Pacman Exercise
An exercise for MIT Full Stack class to make pacman move back and forth across the browser.

## Requirements
A text or code editor, such as Visual Studio.  

## Project Notes
In this assignment we had to edit the code to make the Pacman continue to move across the browser until it reached the other edge, then it should reverse directions. Every time the element moves, the image source should change so it appears that the mouth of the Pacman is opening and closing.

## How to Run
If you'd like to use, you can download the files, open them in your browser to see the animation. You can upload to your project customize any way you'd like.

## Next Steps
Make the pacman change color on each move using CSS. 
Add some actions on click such as reversing or color change.
